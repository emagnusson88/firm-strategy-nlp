The following discussions about our market risk disclosures 
involve forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ 
from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We are 
exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign 
currency exchange rates, and commodity prices.
Interest Rate Risk: The fair value of our cash and cash 
equivalents at April 30, 2018, approximates carrying value. We are 
exposed to interest rate risk with regard to existing debt consisting 
of fixed- and variable-rate maturities. Our interest rate exposure 
primarily includes U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, and commercial 
paper rates in the U.S.
We utilize derivative instruments to manage changes in the fair 
value and cash flows of our debt. Interest rate contracts mitigate 
the risk associated with the underlying hedged item. At the 
inception of the contract, the instrument is evaluated and 
documented for hedge accounting treatment. If the contract is 
designated as a cash flow hedge, the mark-to-market gains or 
losses on the contract are deferred and included as a component of 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and reclassified 
to interest expense in the period during which the hedged 
transaction affects earnings. If the contract is designated as a fair 
value hedge, the contract is recognized at fair value on the balance 
sheet, and changes in the fair value are recognized in interest 
expense. Generally, changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
equal to changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and have 
no net impact on earnings. 
In June 2017, we entered into a treasury lock, with a notional value 
of $300.0, to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility 
associated with anticipated debt financing in 2018. This interest 
rate contract was designated as a cash flow hedge. In December 
2017, concurrent with the pricing of the Senior Notes due 
December 15, 2027, we terminated the treasury lock prior to 
maturity. The termination resulted in a gain of $2.7, which was 
deferred and included as a component of accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized as a reduction 
to interest expense over the life of the debt. 
In 2015, we terminated the interest rate swap on the 3.50 percent 
Senior Notes due October 15, 2021, which was designated as a fair 
value hedge, and used to hedge against the changes in fair value of 
the debt. As a result of the early termination, we received $58.1 in 
cash, which included $4.6 of accrued and prepaid interest and a 
$53.5 benefit that is deferred as a component of the carrying value 
of the long-term debt and is being recognized ratably as a 
reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the related 
debt. At April 30, 2018, the remaining benefit of $28.5 was 
recorded as an increase in the long-term debt balance

commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by supply 
and demand conditions, political and economic variables, weather, 
investor speculation, and other unpredictable factors. To manage 
the volatility related to anticipated commodity purchases, we use 
derivatives with maturities of generally less than one year. We do 
not qualify commodity derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. 
As a result, the gains and losses on all commodity derivatives are 
immediately recognized in cost of products sold.

prices related to commodities. Commodity Price Risk: We use certain raw materials and other
